    ingredients = data.get("ingredients", [])
    
    ingredient_names = []
    for ing in ingredients:
        name = ing.get("ingredient-name")
        ingredient_names.append(name)

Why This Endpoint is Critical:
- Provides complete ingredient list for allergen detection
- Enables automated analysis (no manual ingredient entry)
- Quantities allow nutrition estimation
- Without it: Users would manually type all ingredients (error-prone)


ENDPOINT 3: Recipe Database (Implicit)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Usage Pattern:
Pre-loaded recipe titles for diet plan generation

Data Used:
- Recipe titles from RecipeDB (stored in code)

JACCARD SIMILARITY CALCULATION (Using FlavorDB Data)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Algorithm:
File: allergen_alchemist/chem_utils.py
Function: calculate_jaccard_similarity(molecules_a, molecules_b)

Code:
    set_a = set(molecules_a)  # Original ingredient molecules
    set_b = set(molecules_b)  # Substitute ingredient molecules
    
    intersection = set_a & set_b  # Shared molecules
    union = set_a | set_b         # All unique molecules
    
    if len(union) == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    similarity = len(intersection) / len(union)
    return similarity  # Score between 0.0 and 1.0

Example Calculation:
Original: Butter
- Molecules: ["diacetyl", "butyric acid", "acetoin", "palmitic acid", "oleic acid"]

Substitute: Coconut Oil
- Molecules: ["lauric acid", "capric acid", "oleic acid", "palmitic acid", "myristic acid"]

Intersection (Shared):
- ["oleic acid", "palmitic acid"] → 2 molecules

Union (All Unique):
- ["diacetyl", "butyric acid", "acetoin", "palmitic acid", "oleic acid", 
   "lauric acid", "capric acid", "myristic acid"] → 8 molecules

Jaccard Score:
- 2 / 8 = 0.25 = 25% similarity

Why This is Critical:
- Objective, reproducible scoring
- Based on actual chemical composition
- Explains flavor similarity scientifically
- Without FlavorDB: No molecular data to calculate
