SLIDE 2 – PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

WHO FACES THIS PROBLEM?

• 32 million Americans with food allergies (250M+ globally)
• Parents of children with multiple allergies
• Home cooks serving guests with dietary restrictions
• Health-conscious individuals seeking personalized nutrition

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

Health: 200,000 ER visits annually, potential anaphylaxis
Social: Isolation from dining events, family meal challenges
Economic: Specialty products cost 2-3x more, expensive consultations

EXISTING SOLUTIONS (Gaps)

❌ Generic substitution lists - No scientific basis
❌ Allergy recipe sites - Can't adapt existing recipes
❌ Manual research - Time-consuming, requires chemistry knowledge
❌ Nutritionist consultations - Expensive ($100-300/session)

THE GAP WE FILL

✓ Molecular-level substitute recommendations
✓ Scientific explanation of WHY substitutes work
✓ Automated weekly diet planning
✓ Free, instant access for everyone
✓ Integration of flavor chemistry + allergen data


================================================================================
SLIDE 3 – WHY FOODOSCOPE APIs?
================================================================================

APIS USED

✓ RecipeDB - Recipe and ingredient database
✓ FlavorDB - Molecular flavor compound database
✓ Both integrated for comprehensive analysis

KEY ENDPOINTS & DATA FIELDS

RecipeDB:
1. /recipe-bytitle/recipeByTitle
   • Fields: Recipe_id, Recipe_title
   • Purpose: Search recipes by name

2. /search-recipe/{recipe_id}
   • Fields: ingredients[], ingredient-name, quantity
   • Purpose: Extract complete ingredient lists

3. Recipe Database
   • Used for: Weekly diet plan generation

FlavorDB:
1. /entities_json?id={ingredient_id}
   • Fields: molecules[], common_name
   • Purpose: Fetch molecular flavor profiles
   • Used for: Jaccard similarity calculations

WHY CRITICAL?

RecipeDB:
• Thousands of recipes with structured data
• Standardized ingredient naming → accurate allergen matching
• Enables instant recipe analysis (no manual entry)
• Real recipes users actually want to cook

FlavorDB:
• ONLY database linking ingredients to flavor molecules
• Scientific basis for substitution (not guesswork)
